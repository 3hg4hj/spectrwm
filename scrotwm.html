Welcome to Scrotwm's website.<p>
<small>
Scrotwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11.
It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can
be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do
any configuration.
<p>
It was largely inspired by 
<a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>
and
<a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm/">dwm</a>
.
Both are fine products but suffer from things like:
crazy-unportable-language-syndrome, silly defaults, asymmetrical window
layout, "how hard can it be?" and good old NIH.
Nevertheless  dwm was a phenomenal resource and many good ideas and code
was borrowed from it.
On the other hand xmonad has great defaults, key bindings and xinerama
support but is crippled by not being written in C.
<p>
It was written by Marco Peereboom & Ryan Thomas McBride on
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>
and it is released under the ISC
<a href="license.html">license</a>.
Patches can be accepted provided they are ISC licensed.<br>
