spectrwm
========

spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling and reparenting window manager for X11. It
tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be used
for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to
learn a language to do any configuration. It is written by hackers for hackers
and it strives to be small, compact and fast.

It was largely inspired by [http://xmonad.org xmonad] and
[http://dwm.suckless.org dwm]. Both are fine products but suffer from things
like: crazy-unportable-language-syndrome, silly defaults, asymmetrical window
layout, "how hard can it be?" and good old NIH.  Nevertheless
[http://dwm.suckless.org dwm] was a phenomenal resource and many good ideas and
code was borrowed from it. On the other hand [http://xmonad.org xmonad] has
great defaults, key bindings and xinerama support but is crippled by not being
written in C.

spectrwm is a beautiful pearl! For it too, was created by grinding irritation.
Nothing is a bigger waste of time than moving windows around until they are the
right size-ish or having just about any relevant key combination being eaten
for some task one never needs. The path of agony is too long to quote and in
classical [http://www.openbsd.org OpenBSD] fashion (put up, or hack up) a brand
new window manager was whooped up to serve no other purpose than to obey its
masters. It is released under the ISC license. Patches can be accepted provided
they are ISC licensed as well.
